# Ionic - Anhembi (2021/1)

This repository contains all the code produced at the "Mobile Devices" lectures for the first semester of 2021 at Universidade Anhembi Morumbi. Feel free to look around the branches, there are a couple of interesting apps. However, be aware that most of the code was written with teaching in mind, so there's very little I'd call "production-ready code".

## Showcase

In addition, here's a list of most of the projects developed by students under my supervision during the course. The disclosure of every project on the list has been allowed by their authors. Some of them are hosted as PWAs on Netlify, while some have an .apk available for downloading.
